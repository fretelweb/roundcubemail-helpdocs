The user preferences let you adjust various options and settings that control the behavior and the UI of the webmail application.
The numerous settings are grouped by the following sections:

.. _settings-prefs-ui:

User Interface
--------------

**Language**
    The webmail is available in numerous languages. Switch it here if you like.
    When accessing the application, the language is automatically chosen from your computer's operating system language.

**Time zone**
    Dates displayed anywhere (e.g. when a message is sent) will be automatically translated into your local time zone.
    Set this to *Auto* to let the system use your computer's time zone settings or select a sepecif time zone from the list.

**Time format**
    Select how time (hours, minutes) are displayed.

**Date format**
    Select the format how dates shoudl be displayed.

**Pretty dates**
    With this option checked, dates close to today will be translated into relative terms like "Today", "Yesterday", etc.

**Refresh**
    Set the interval where you want the system to check for updates (e.g. for new messages arrived)

**Interface Skin**
    Choose the visual apearance of the user interface from a selection of themes.

** Browser options**
    You can register this webmail app to be opened when ever you click an email link somewhere on the web.


.. _settings-prefs-mailbox:

Mailbox View
------------

**Show preview pane**
    This shows or hides the :ref:`mail-preview-pane` in the mail view.

**Mark previewed messages read**
    Select the delay to mark new messages as "read" when opening them in the preview pane.

**Request for receipts**
    This option controls the behavior when you open message the sender requested a receipt when you read it.

**Expand message threads**
    When listing messages in :ref:`threads <mail-list-thread>`, this option controls how conversation groups are
    eypanded in the list.

**Rows per page**
    The messages list displays this number of messages at a time (aka a "page"). Increasing this number may result
    in longer loading times when opeaning a mailbox folder.

**Check all folders for new messages**
    By default, only the Inbox is checked for new messages periodically. If you have server-side filters installed
    that will move incoming messages to other folders, you should check this option.


.. _settings-prefs-mailview:

Displaying Messages
-------------------

**Open message in a new window**
    With this option checked, double-clicking a message in the email view will open it in a new window instead of
    the current browser window/tab.
    
**Display HTML**
    Check this option to display formatted messages as the sender intended it. When disabled, formatted emails will
    be converted to plain text.

**Display remote inline images**
    Formatted (HTML) messages can contain references to images which have to be loaded from a remote server.
    That can harm your privacy and reveil to the sender that you opened the message. This technique is often used
    by spammers to verify that your email address works and you can be sent more spam.

**Display attached images below the message**
    Enable this option if you want image attachments being displayed below the message text.

**After message delete/move display the next message**
    Controls whether the screen should jump to the next message in the list when opening an email message
    (not in the preview pane) and then move or delete it.
